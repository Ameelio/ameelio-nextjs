It was awesome seeing pple tht dont normally get mail start to get mail bc of the ameelio app. It truly makes a huge difference in your day behind bars when you get mail and it boosts your confidence knowing the world may keep on spinning without you but that there is at least someone tht notices your absence and misses you. I HIGHLY recommend this app for your incarcerated loved ones",
