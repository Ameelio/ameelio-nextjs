                Prison communications are expensive, posing an obstacle to
                family contact. While increased family contact can reduce
                recidivism by 56%, the cost of staying in touch with an
                incarcerated loved one forces 1 in 3 families into debt. It is
                in the public interest to ensure that incarcerated people can
                easily maintain supportive relationships with their friends and
                family on the outside.
              </p>
              <p className="break-normal mb-4">
                While on the outside we have access to free video calls, email,
                and very inexpensive phone calls, incarcerated people may need
                to pay as much as $25 per call and $1.50 per email. The profits
                from these services support a $3 billion industry that is
                dominated by a private equity backed duopoly.

                Thatâ€™s why Ameelio exists, to disrupt the for-profit prison
                communications industry, and provide a suite of communication
                tools which support family contact and break the cycle of
                intergenerational harm. By providing a free video and
                e-messaging platform, and by making it easy for corrections
                officials to adopt our platform, we serve the public by
                promoting accessible quality family contact in a secure
                correctional environment. Beyond family contact, we encourage
                officials to use our suite of communications tools to supplement
                existing programming to improve rehabilitative outcomes. With
                our low-cost technology, we can support secure contact between
                incarcerated individuals and their counselors, educators, and
                programs in a way that is impossible under the incumbent
                for-profit model.
